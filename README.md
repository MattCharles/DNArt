# DNArt
Parse your boring old nucleobases into cool nonsense!

Pretty simple stuff really. Parse 8 characters -> 1 pixel.

A = 00
T = 01
G = 10
C = 11

Then, with 16-bit color, we can turn your DNA into a cool piece of (probably super ugly) wall art.

# TODO:

Write to an image instead of just a text file.

# Other ideas:

Apply the colors as a filter to a greyscale image chosen by the user
